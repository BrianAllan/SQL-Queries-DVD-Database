## SQL Queries of a Relational Database for a DVD Rental Company

### Project Description

This project was produced in 2019 for the course **"Introduction to SQL"** as part of Udacity's **_Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program_**.

The data came from the Sakila DVD Rental Database.  The project tasks were to:

- develop four questions to explore using the database
- create SQL queries to obtain data for answering the questions
- create visualizations for answering the questions from the data returned by the SQL queries
- create a slide presentation with the questions and the visualizations

The results of the SQL queries were saved as CSV files and these were then used in Google Sheets to produce visualizations which were subsequently incorporated into a [slide presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSb-P6llVtO7PTo6mH9NAJUBa-WRGmnYiyERJibu7eClBwIVkNPsxIocWtIipys40tGvx36TxgSkqlz/pub?start=true&loop=true&delayms=10000) using Google Slides.  The four SQL queries were submitted for evaluation as a single text file, here [SQL_Project.txt](https://github.com/BrianAllan/SQL-Queries-DVD-Database/blob/master/SQL_Project.txt).

### Files Used
